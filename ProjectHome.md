C++ math lib for game and 3D-graphics programming with GPU shading language-like classes such as vec2, vec3, vec4, mat4, plus helper functions. GLSL specs followed closely. Robust implementation: All results checked in debug build + many unit tests. The library is available under BSD/MIT license.

slmath is very platform independent and is known to compile on following platforms:
+ Visual Studio 2003, 2008 and 2010
+ iPhone (various versions)
+ Linux
+ Symbian
+ Nokia Maemo
+ Android NDK
+ Samsung Bada
+ Windows Mobile
As such, slmath makes excellent companion for OpenGL and OpenGL ES development, whatever your platform might be. You can use it also without OpenGL as it has no dependencies.

slmath is very stable and bug-free library: It's development started in sourceforge July 31, 2006, and it's still in very active use.
